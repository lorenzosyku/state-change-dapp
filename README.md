# Intro to the Dapp

This Dapp was build as a Web3 demo project on ETH-testnet, during the coaching call hosted by Brian H. Hough. In this Dapp any user is able to connect with its MetaMask Wallet through web3 library and can read/write data from/to the blockchain. The smart contract was programmed in Solidity and compiled through Truffle.

# Functionality

First connect your MetaMask wallet, then if you want to get the state click the button 'Get the state' and you'll see what's the number that a previuos user put. If you want to change that number in the input field you can put your own number and then click on 'Update the state', your MetaMask wallet will pop up indicating that you need to confirm this transaction, after you confirm and pay the gas fee, the state will successfully changed.
